              The Casparian strip is a barrier in the endodermal cell walls of plants that allows the selective uptake of nutrients and water. In the model plant
              Arabidopsis thaliana
              , its development and establishment are under the control of a receptor-ligand mechanism termed the Schengen pathway. This pathway facilitates barrier formation and activates downstream compensatory responses in case of dysfunction. However, due to a very tight functional association with the Casparian strip, other potential signaling functions of the Schengen pathway remain obscure. In this work, we created a MYB36-dependent synthetic positive feedback loop that drives Casparian strip formation independently of Schengen-induced signaling. We evaluated this by subjecting plants in which the Schengen pathway has been uncoupled from barrier formation, as well as a number of established barrier-mutant plants, to agar-based and soil conditions that mimic agricultural settings. Under the latter conditions, the Schengen pathway is necessary for the establishment of nitrogen-deficiency responses in shoots. These data highlight Schengen signaling as an essential hub for the adaptive integration of signaling from the rhizosphere to aboveground tissues.},

              Plant photosynthesis contains two functional modules, the light-driven reactions in the thylakoid membrane and the carbon-fixing reactions in the chloroplast stroma. In nature, light availability for photosynthesis often undergoes massive and rapid fluctuations. Efficient and productive use of such variable light supply requires an instant crosstalk and rapid synchronization of both functional modules. Here, we show that this communication involves the stromal exposed C-terminus of the thylakoid K
              +
              -exchange antiporter KEA3, which regulates the ΔpH across the thylakoid membrane and therefore pH-dependent photoprotection. By combining in silico, in vitro, and in vivo approaches, we demonstrate that the KEA3 C-terminus senses the energy state of the chloroplast in a pH-dependent manner and regulates transport activity in response. Together our data pinpoint a regulatory feedback loop by which the stromal energy state orchestrates light capture and photoprotection via multi-level regulation of KEA3.},
